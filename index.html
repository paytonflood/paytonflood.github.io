            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate developer, I graduated from the University of Wisconsin La-Crosse with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. During my time as a student, I was also a dedicated college athlete, competing on the track team.</p>
            <p>My love for coding began early, and it continues to be a driving force in my life. Whether I'm building web applications, learning new technologies, or working on side projects, I'm always seeking ways to enhance my skills and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Aside from coding, I'm an avid Star Wars fan and enjoy staying active through various physical activities. I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle and am constantly looking for opportunities to improve myself both personally and professionally.</p>
            <p>I'm excited to share my projects and experiences with you through this portfolio. Thank you for visiting!</p>
